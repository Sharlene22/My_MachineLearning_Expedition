# Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Convolutional Neural Network
This project contains the implementation of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for the detection of brain tumor classification, including glioma, meningioma, and pituitary diseases. The primary objective is to achieve high classification accuracy within a short time frame.

Dataset Collection and Pre-processing : Collected a comprehensive Brain MRI dataset from Kaggle, which serves as the basis for training and testing our model. Prior to training, we applied pre-processing techniques to the dataset. This involved identifying extreme contour points and cropping the images to focus on the relevant brain regions.

Model Architecture : Adopted the EfficientNet-B1 model, which is a pre-trained model on the ImageNet dataset. This model offers a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for our classification task.

Training and Validation : The model was trained on the pre-processed training dataset and validated using a separate validation dataset. During training, we achieved an impressive training accuracy of 99.53%.
